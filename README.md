# ENGN4528 Computer Vision Lab 2

This is CLab-2 for ENGN4528. The goal of this lab is to help you get familiar with, and practice middle-level computer vision algorithms: feature point detection, matching, image region segmentation. Practise Eigen-Face based technique for face representation, detection, and recognition.

Task 1: Harris Corner Detector

Task 2: K-Means Clustering and Colour Image Segmentation

Task 3: Face Recognition using Eigenface
